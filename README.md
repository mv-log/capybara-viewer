# Capybara Image Viewer

## About This Project

This project, titled "Capybara Image Viewer," is a web-based application developed as part of my learning journey in web development with the assistance of ChatGPT. It's designed to showcase various features relevant to Capybaras - the world's largest rodent, known for its friendly and sociable nature. This application is perfect for those who share a love for capybaras and wish to see random images of these adorable creatures.

## Key Features

- **Random Capybara Images**: On the click of a button, view random images of capybaras sourced from Flickr's API.
- **Dual-Option Viewing**: Choose between two options - Capybara or Corgi images, catering to the interests of animal lovers.
- **Dynamic Content**: Each button click fetches a new, random image from the respective category.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and user-friendly interface, making it easy for anyone to enjoy.
